# RxSync: Machine Learning Symptom-Based Medicine Recommendation System

**RxSync** is a Python-based project that leverages machine learning to predict possible diseases based on user-reported symptoms. After training and comparing five different models, the most accurate one was selected to power the predictions. Built using **Jupyter Notebook** and **Streamlit**, RxSync offers a simple and intuitive interface that supports translation into over 50 languages via **Google Translate**, making it accessible to users across the globe.

## Project Goals
- Develop an intelligent system that predicts potential diseases based on symptoms.
- Ensure accessibility through a multilingual interface supporting over 50 languages.
- Select and implement the most effective machine learning model for disease prediction.
- Provide a platform that is easy to navigate and accessible to non-technical users.

## Target Audience Needs
- **Early Disease Detection**: RxSync provides an easy-to-use tool that allows users to input symptoms and receive a list of potential diseases, promoting proactive health care.
- **Global Accessibility**: By integrating Google Translate, RxSync reaches users from various linguistic backgrounds, expanding its usability across different regions.
- **Health Assistance in Underserved Areas**: RxSync can be especially useful in regions with limited healthcare resources, offering preliminary insights to guide users in seeking medical attention.

## Project Workflow
1. **Model Training**: Five machine learning models were trained and evaluated. The model with the highest accuracy was selected for the final predictions.
2. **Symptom Analysis**: The app maps user symptoms to potential diseases using a structured prediction model.
3. **Multilingual Interface**: Integration of Google Translate via Streamlit enables translation of the appâ€™s interface into over 50 languages.
4. **User-Centered Design**: RxSync was built with non-technical users in mind, featuring a clean and straightforward interface that provides immediate feedback based on user input.
5. **Insightful Data Visualization**: Visual components, such as charts and graphs, were included to display symptom patterns and prediction results for different demographic groups.

## Key Features
- **Machine Learning Predictions**: User symptom input is analyzed to predict potential diseases.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports translation into over 50 languages using Google Translate.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for a clean, intuitive experience.
